JADE++ is a high performance implementation of adaptive differential
evolution optimization algorithm from Jingqiao Zhang and Arthur
C. Sanderson book 'Adaptive Differential Evolution. A Robust Approach
to Multimodal Problem Optimization' Springer, 2009.  JADE++ is
designed to run efficiently in parallel on multicore processors,
multiprocessor systems, clusters and supercomputers with help of MPI.

JADE++ needs MPI and Cmake installed to compile and run. It also needs
C++11 compatible complier.

For Debian/Ubuntu systems single line install with
# apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev cmake
 
./go.sh normaly should compile JADE++ and run tests, edit it
to run JADE++ on your number of processes.
